# Twilio Flex Plugin - External Phone ANI Overwrite

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

This plugin adds a listener before a task acceptable to ovewrite the FROM number that shows when leveraging an External SIP Endpoint (phone).  Out of box, the DNIS (the number the customer dialed) will show in the FROM header of your external sip endpoint.  This plugin overwrites that with the customer's ANI as the FROM.


Before this plugin the DNIS will show up as the "FROM" on the External Phone
![Plugin Demo](TBD)

After this plugin is enabled the ANI will show up as the "FROM on the External Phon
![Plugin Demo](TBD)
